# mobile_testing_report

Completed comprehensive mobile testing of the website. The initial layout and audio playback functionalities are working correctly. However, core interaction features like reacting and saving posts are blocked by a login requirement, which prevents further testing. The console logs confirm that these actions fail because the user is not authenticated. 

**Key Findings:**
- **Mobile Layout:** The website displays a well-structured and mobile-friendly layout.
- **Audio Playback:** Audio playback starts correctly, and the UI updates with the necessary controls. Switching between audio tracks works as expected.
- **Interaction Issues:** Reacting to and saving posts fail because they require user authentication. This is a major blocker for testing these features.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement a test login functionality to allow for comprehensive testing of all user-dependent features.
- Provide clear feedback to unauthenticated users when they attempt to perform actions that require a login.
