### Authentication Modal Test Summary

**Test Objectives:**

I have completed the testing of the authentication modal on the provided website. The primary goal was to verify the functionality of the tab-based interface for both signing in and signing up.

**Execution Process:**

1.  Navigated to the website and confirmed the presence of a single "Sign In" button.
2.  Clicked the "Sign In" button to open the authentication modal.
3.  Verified that the modal correctly displays "Sign In" and "Sign Up" tabs.
4.  Tested the tab switching functionality.
5.  Inspected the input fields on both tabs to ensure they were appropriate for each action.
6.  Created a test account using the "Sign Up" tab.
7.  Logged in with the newly created account via the "Sign In" tab.
8.  Logged out and reopened the modal to confirm it defaults to the "Sign In" tab.
9.  Checked the browser console for errors.

**Key Findings:**

*   The UI and user flow of the authentication modal are implemented correctly and meet all specified test objectives.
*   A critical backend error was discovered in the console logs, indicating that the user profile creation is failing. This is a high-priority issue that needs to be addressed.

**Core Conclusions:**

While the front-end implementation of the authentication modal is excellent, the backend issue prevents the application from functioning as intended. The final report provides a detailed walkthrough of the testing process, including screenshots and a description of the critical error.

**Final Deliverables:**

*   A detailed testing report in markdown format.
*   Screenshots documenting the testing process.
