# ThirtyVoice_Auth_Flow_Test

The user signup flow for ThirtyVoice is currently blocked due to a critical bug in the email validation. All attempts to create a new user account failed with an 'email_address_invalid' error, preventing any further testing of authenticated features. This issue requires immediate attention to enable user registration on the platform.
