# authentication_flow_test

**Testing Report**

**Objective:** Test the complete authentication flow on https://nykw5isugieu.space.minimax.io.

**Summary of Findings:**
The "Sign In" button on the homepage is unresponsive. Despite multiple attempts to click the button, the authentication modal did not appear. This prevented any further testing of the sign-up and sign-in processes. No console errors were observed, suggesting a potential issue with the button's event handler or associated JavaScript.

**Test Steps Executed:**
1. Navigated to the website: https://nykw5isugieu.space.minimax.io
2. Attempted to click the "Sign In" button multiple times.

**Expected Result:** The authentication modal should open, allowing the user to sign in or sign up.

**Actual Result:** The "Sign In" button is not functional, and the authentication modal does not open.

**Conclusion:** The authentication flow is critically blocked due to the non-functional "Sign In" button. It is recommended to investigate the button's implementation to resolve this issue.
