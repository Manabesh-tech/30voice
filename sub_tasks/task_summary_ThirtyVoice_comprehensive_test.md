# ThirtyVoice_comprehensive_test

The comprehensive test of the ThirtyVoice deployment at https://bgvinyqdmu34.space.minimax.io could not be completed. The website is not functioning correctly in the testing environment, which prevents interaction with key elements such as the sign-in modal and the search bar. The front-end application appears to be incompatible with the testing tools, likely due to issues with JavaScript execution or modal rendering. Further investigation by the development team is required to enable testing.
