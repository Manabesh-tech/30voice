# ThirtyVoice Website Test

I have completed the testing of the ThirtyVoice website. The critical audio auto-play bug was not found. However, I discovered several other critical issues, including a missing 'Sign In' button, broken 'Filter by Vibe' functionality, and the absence of a search feature. I have documented my findings in the attached screenshots.
