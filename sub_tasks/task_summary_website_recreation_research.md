# website_recreation_research

I have examined the website at https://c2aa5mh0owtu.space.minimax.io/ and gathered the necessary information to recreate it. I have taken both a viewport and full-page screenshot to capture the visual design. I have also extracted the text content of the page. This information should be sufficient to recreate the website with the requested cursor fix.

## Key Files

- browser/screenshots/screenshot_20250803_023323.png: Viewport screenshot of the website
- browser/screenshots/screenshot_20250803_023357.png: Full-page screenshot of the website
- browser/extracted_content/thirtyvoice_summary.json: JSON file containing the extracted text content of the website
