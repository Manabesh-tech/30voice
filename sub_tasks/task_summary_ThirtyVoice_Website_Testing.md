# ThirtyVoice_Website_Testing


**Test Summary**

I have completed the functional testing of the ThirtyVoice website based on the provided requirements. The following is a summary of my findings:

**1. Original Design Preservation:**

*   **Observation:** The website's visual design, including the purple header, fonts, colors, and layout, appears to be consistent with the original ThirtyVoice design. No significant visual deviations were observed.
*   **Conclusion:** The website has successfully preserved the original purple design.

**2. Unified Sign In/Sign Up Button:**

*   **Observation:** The header contains a single "Sign In" button. Clicking this button opens a modal. However, the modal's title is "Sign in to interact" instead of the required "Sign In to ThirtyVoice". The modal does feature a unified authentication message at the bottom.
*   **Conclusion:** The unified sign-in/sign-up button is present and functional, but the modal title is incorrect.

**3. Text Field Cursor Fix:**

*   **Observation:** When a long string of text is entered into the search field in the "Discover Voice Stories" section, the text remains within the field's bounds and is not truncated. The cursor also remains visible.
*   **Conclusion:** The text field cursor fix is implemented correctly.

**4. Audio Recording Functionality:**

*   **Observation:** Clicking the "Share Your Voice" button does not open the recording interface directly. Instead, it prompts the user to sign in by opening the same modal as the "Sign In" button.
*   **Conclusion:** The audio recording functionality could not be tested due to a login requirement.

**5. Console Errors:**

*   **Observation:** The browser's console logs show multiple errors related to audio playback. These errors indicate that the application is failing to load audio files from both local and remote sources.
*   **Conclusion:** There are critical errors in the audio playback functionality that need to be addressed.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The website's visual design is well-preserved, and the text field cursor fix is working as expected. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

*   The title of the authentication modal is incorrect.
*   The audio recording functionality is inaccessible without logging in, which prevented me from testing it.
*   There are significant errors in the audio playback functionality, as evidenced by the console logs.

**Recommendations:**

*   Correct the title of the authentication modal to "Sign In to ThirtyVoice".
*   Investigate and fix the audio playback errors to ensure that users can listen to the voice stories.
*   Consider allowing users to access the recording interface without needing to sign in first, or provide test credentials to allow for more thorough testing.

**Final Deliverables:**

*   `search_field_cursor_fix_verification.png`: A screenshot of the search field with a long string of text.
*   `recording_interface_verification.png`: A screenshot showing that the "Share Your Voice" button leads to the authentication modal.
