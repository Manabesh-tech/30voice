# ThirtyVoice_Website_Test

## ThirtyVoice Website Test

**Execution Process:**

1.  Navigated to the ThirtyVoice website at https://75iuqhz68z7g.space.minimax.io.
2.  Captured a full-page screenshot of the homepage to evaluate the design and layout.
3.  Analyzed the screenshot to verify the design elements, including the purple header, hero section, community voices section, filter section, and voice note cards.
4.  Tested the audio functionality by clicking on multiple audio playback buttons and capturing screenshots to verify the behavior.
5.  Confirmed that audio plays, only one audio plays at a time, and the audio controls are functional.
6.  Verified that voice notes, user profiles, reaction buttons, and listen counters appear to be loading correctly.
7.  Checked the browser console for any errors.

**Key Findings:**

*   The website's design is a close match to the original ThirtyVoice.com design.
*   The audio playback functionality is working correctly on the desktop view.
*   All content appears to be loading and displaying correctly.
*   No console errors were detected.

**Core Conclusions:**

The ThirtyVoice website is well-deployed and functional on a desktop browser. The design is replicated accurately, and the core audio features are working as expected. Due to limitations of the testing environment, I was unable to specifically test for mobile responsiveness.

**Final Deliverables:**

*   Homepage Screenshot: `homepage_screenshot.png`
*   Audio Playback Screenshots: `audio_1_playing.png`, `audio_2_playing.png`
*   This summary report.
