# thirtyvoice_functionality_check

Checked the functionality of the 'About', 'Feedback', 'View transcript' and 'reply' features on thirtyvoice.com. The 'About' and 'Feedback' links open modals, 'View transcript' expands the voice note to show the transcript, and the reply functionality is not available to non-logged-in users.
