# ThirtyVoice_Mobile_Test

I have completed the mobile testing of thirtyvoice.com. 

**Summary of Findings:**

*   **Website Appearance:** The website appears to be mobile-friendly. A screenshot of the mobile view has been captured.
*   **Console Errors:** The browser console shows significant errors related to audio playback. The website is attempting to load audio from two different sources, and both are failing.
*   **Audio Playback:** The audio playback functionality is broken. Clicking the "Listen" button does not play any audio, which is consistent with the console errors.
*   **Interactive Elements:** The reaction buttons are functional. Clicking on a reaction button correctly registers the interaction and updates the corresponding count.
