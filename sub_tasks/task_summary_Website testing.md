# Website testing

I have completed the testing of the website. The website loads correctly, and the search functionality is working. I was able to create an account and log in successfully. The 30-second timer for the voice recorder also works as expected. However, I encountered a critical issue where new messages are not being displayed on the feed after being posted. This prevented me from testing the delete and threaded reply functionalities. I have documented this issue and recommend that it be investigated and resolved.
