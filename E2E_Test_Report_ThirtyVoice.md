# E2E Test Report: ThirtyVoice Website

**Date of Testing:** 2025-08-02
**Website URL:** `https://ktir9vxmdpdq.space.minimax.io`

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the continuation of an end-to-end testing session for the ThirtyVoice website. The tests covered critical user interaction points including the feedback modal, transcript functionality, audio playback, search and filtering, and various modal triggers.

**Critical Finding:** The most significant issue discovered was the failure of the feedback submission system. While the user interface displays a success message, the submission fails on the backend, as confirmed by console error logs showing a `400` HTTP status from the `/submit-feedback` edge function. User feedback is currently not being captured.

Other minor issues and observations are detailed in the specific test cases below. All other tested features were found to be functioning as expected.

## 3. Conclusion & Recommendations

The website is largely functional, with most interactive elements performing as expected. However, the **failure of the backend feedback submission is a critical bug** that requires immediate attention. The "Show Filters" button is also non-functional, which hinders user experience, although a workaround exists.

**Recommendations:**
1.  **High Priority:** Debug the `submit-feedback` Supabase edge function to resolve the `400` error and ensure feedback is stored correctly.
2.  **Medium Priority:** Investigate and fix the unresponsive "Show Filters" button.
3.  **Low Priority:** Consider clearing the feedback form fields after a successful submission to prevent accidental re-submission of the same content.
